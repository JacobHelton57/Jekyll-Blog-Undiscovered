# Jekyll-Blog-Undiscovered

This website is intended to demonstrate the implementation/usage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") to simplify the website building process.

By using Jekyll's build in [Liquid Syntax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/ "Liquid Syntax"), templating becomes a breeze. Jekyll's blogging engine also allows for easy uploading of new files to a blog once it has been set up.

For layout, I am using [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com "startbootstrap.com's")'s [Blog Home](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/blog-home/ "Blog Home") template and their [Blog Post](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/blog-post/ "Blog Post") template. This allowed me to remove my focus from design and instead focus on the core implementation of jekyll within the site.

For the sample content, I have borrowed the copyright-free content from Leo Babauta's blog, [zenhabits.net](https://zenhabits.net/ "zenhabits.net"). This blog was excellent for borrowing content for a few reasons:
### It is copyright free
This meant that I was free to reproduce, repost, and modify the content however I choose.
### It has a good blend of minimal blogging and tasteful use of blog elements
Some of these elements include blockquotes, bold text, numbered and bulleted lists, and headings.
### Posts are a good length
They are long enough to fill up a page without being so lengthy that they become an eyesore.

**Bonus:** Some of the blogs are super interesting!
